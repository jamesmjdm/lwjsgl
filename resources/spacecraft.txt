main systems
    • reactor
    • engines
    • weapons
        energy blaster
            - consumes energy
        plasma cannon
            - consumes energy
            - slower firing and more damaging
            - slight homing effect
            - some damage through shields
        particle beam
            - consumes energy
            - beam has finite length depending on level
        ion blaster
            - consumes energy
            - drain enemy ships' energy
        flak cannon
            - fires scrap
        railgun
            - fires railgun ammo
            - consumes energy
        missile
            - fires rocket ammo
            - speed,maneouvrability,range,damage
        named / heroic weapons
            - generally consume energy
            - some kinds might consume other resources
    • shields
    • hull strength / armour
    • cargo space
    • hardpoints and turrets
    • sensors, radar, comms

    ship reactor generates and stores energy at a constant rate
    engine thrust consumes energy (at a low rate)
    shield bubble absorbs multiple hits before dissolving
    creating a shield bubble consumes a lot of energy

combat
    the aim of combat is to deplete the enemy's energy
    without energy, no weapons or engines or shields
