	spaceships

		mechanics:
			reactor generates and stores energy at a certain rate
			engines consume energy continuously depending on throttle
			weapons consume energy or ammo every shot
			shields intercept damage, consume energy to recharge
			drones consume energy continuously while deployed
			warping consumes energy while charging

		reactor (powers everything)
		hull/armour
		cargo space
		wings/controls/flaps (manoeuvrability)
		hardpoints/turret
		computer/hacking/ai

		engines
			antimatter rocket
			proton turbine
			- warp factor
		shields
		weapons
			energy blaster
			plasma
			particle beam
			missiles
				- various speeds/warheads
				- various homing abilities
			trip-mines
				- block pursuers
		drones (?)

		sensors/radar/tracking/jamming
			- missiles and drones can be jammed
		cloaking/stealth

		augmentations/abilities:
			power storage
				- provides extra power. charges above 90%
			grounding/lightning rod
				- fly through ion/plasma storms in nebulae
			warp bubble
				- allows to traverse wormholes safely
			countermeasures
				- deceive missiles
			faster reloading
			pre-charger/"pre-igniter"
			shield capacitor
				- provides superfast shield regeneration, at double energy cost
			mining arm
				- mine from asteroids
			tractor beam
				- move stuff around

		computer programs
			off-bore tracking
				- missiles can be shot in any direction
			autopilot
				- provides several functions
				- evasive "guns defense"
				- pursuit

		


	Notes:
		Turrets are not a silver bullet for slow-turning ships
		Turret tracking speed is not that fast
		You can turn the ship in the same direction to increase the tracking speed though

		Turret hardpoints are less accurate than fixed hardpoints.
